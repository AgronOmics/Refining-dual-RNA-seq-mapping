**Title:** Refining dual RNA-seq mapping: sequential and combined approaches in host-parasitic plant dynamics

**Summary:**  
This study evaluates the application of dual RNA-seq to investigate the interactions between host and parasitic plants. Two mapping approaches are compared:
- **Sequential Approach:** Reads are mapped in two steps, first to the host genome and then to the parasite genome (or vice versa).
- **Combined Approach:** Reads are mapped to a concatenated genome (host + parasite) in a single step.

The results show a high mapping rate (around 90%) and minimal cross-mapping, confirming the effectiveness of the dual RNA-seq approach in accurately separating transcripts from the two organisms. The study also includes an evaluation of precision, sensitivity, accuracy, and specificity metrics, which are all very high, demonstrating the reliability of the methods used.

**Objective:**  
To demonstrate that dual RNA-seq analysis, through both sequential and combined approaches, is a valid strategy to study host-parasite interactions, while minimizing errors due to cross-mapping.
