# Dual RNA-seq Analysis Results

**Mapping Rate:**  
- Both approaches (sequential and combined) achieved mapping rates around 90%.

**Cross-mapping:**  
- The sequential approach showed minimal cross-mapping (around 1%).
- The combined approach further reduced cross-mapping (less than 0.2%).

**Evaluation Metrics:**  
- **Precision, Sensitivity, Specificity, and Accuracy:** All metrics are very close to 1, confirming the reliability of the methodology.

**Conclusions:**  
- The dual RNA-seq technique proved effective in accurately distinguishing the transcripts of host and parasitic species.
- The combined approach offers advantages in terms of reduced processing time and better management of cross-mapping reads.
